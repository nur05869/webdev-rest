# webdev-rest

## Description

This repository contains starter code for a REST API project for a web development course. The project is built using JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js to set up a RESTful API that handles HTTP requests for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources. It was a foundational project for learning how to implement RESTful services in my web development class.

## Structure

- **public**: Contains static files served by the server.
- **src**: Contains the main server script and route handlers.
  - **rest_server.mjs**: Main server script handling HTTP requests.
  - **other server files**: Additional scripts for handling specific routes and middleware.
- **package.json**: Lists project dependencies and scripts necessary for running the project.
- **package-lock.json**: Auto-generated file that describes the exact dependency tree and versions used.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as `node_modules`.
